# UnityPythonWebsocketExample
 
Needs a version of Python 3, which is added to the system path installed to work.

This is a Example project in which Unity starts a python script then uses Websockets to communicate between the Python and C# systems.

This would be an ideal for using TensorFlow Agents for Reinforcement Learning, without the restrictions of ML-Agents.

I would recommend any python code be compiled into a executable.
